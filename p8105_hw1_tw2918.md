# Problem 1

1.  Load the moderndive library, and the early_january_weather dataset:

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

2.  Write a short description of the dataset using inline R code

- Variables in this dataset
  - There are 15 variables in this dataset, which shows the weather in
    Newark from January 1st to January 15th, 2023.
    1.  `origin` variable shows the location of the data and only have
        one value `origin = EWR`.
    2.  `year` `month` `day` and `hour`variables shows the date and time
        of the data. The `year` and `month` variables only have one
        value `year = 2013`, `month = 1`. The `day` and `hour` are
        categorical variables with value `day = 1-15`,`time = 0-23` .
    3.  `temp` is the temperature dgrees in fahrenheit
    4.  `dewp` is the dew point, showing the temperature the air needs
        to be cooled to (at constant pressure) in order to achieve a
        relative humidity (RH) of 100%.
    5.  `humid` is the humidity of the air in percentage.
    6.  `wind_dir` is the wind direction of the time in degrees.
    7.  `wind_speed` is the wind speek of the time in meters per second.
    8.  `wind_gust` is wind guest, a brief increase in the speed of the
        wind, measured in miles per hour
    9.  `precip`is the precipitation, showing the chance newark will be
        receive snow.
    10. `pressure` is the weather pressure measured in millibars.
    11. `visib` is the visiblity in kilometers.
    12. `time_hour` listed year, month, date and time.
- Size of the dataset
  - There are 358 observations in this dataset
  - The number of row of this dataset is 358.
  - The number of columns of this dataset is 15.
- The mean temperature
  - The mean temperature is 39.5821229.
